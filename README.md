# Neural-Network
In this project we have immplemented neural network in c++ using MNISTQ
File training.cpp: the code for training a neural network
File testing.cpp: the code for testing a trained neural network
File model-neural-network.dat: contains the weights of the neural network
File training-report.dat, testing-report.dat: report files, saving results of training and testing(i haven't uploaded these files)
MNIST database is avalable on MNIST site you can download it from there.
